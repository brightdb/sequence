# Sequence

This is a prototype of a CRDT for sequential data written in Elm.

**Work in progress!** Use with caution.

Implementation stems from Nedelec et al. "LSEQ: an adaptive structure for sequences in distributed collaborative editing" (2013).

## Example

For a collaborative editor demo project using this CRDT look [here](brightdb/brightdb-text).
